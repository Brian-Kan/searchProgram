I finally got another chance to review your code.  And I have questions.

In the line below, ".container" is what exactly?  I know you don't have access to my markup and all but I was trying to figure this out.

You're going through the dom and selecting something with the class of container.  Before the end of this element we are inserting a <p> with the markup joined by spaces.

document.querySelector('.container').insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', <p>${markup.join('')}</p>);




In the line below you're going through the article itself and splitting it by word.  

You are using a ternary operator so that IF the word matches the search word (via includes) is true you add the word with spans around it ELSE join the words together seperated by a space?

const markup = textRetrieval.split(" ").map(word => word.includes(state.searchedWord) ? <span class="highlight">${word}</span> : (word).join('');

document.querySelector('.container').insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', <p>${markup}</p>);
last two lines
so you'd have an array with ["Hi", "my", "<span class="highlight">name</span>"]
if your search term was "name"



which turns it into "Hi my <span class="highlight">name</span>" when you join
SO WHEN YOU RENDER IT AS MARKUP
you get that highlight
in the HTML


At which point did we put all the words into an array?  From what I can tell (using methods like 'includes') ALL the words in the article have to be in an array.

should be

document.querySelector('.container').insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', <p>${markup.join('')}</p>);
const markup = textRetrieval.split(" ").map(word => word.includes(state.searchedWord) ? <span class="highlight">${word}</span> : (word).join('');
document.querySelector('.container').insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', <p>${markup}</p>);

THERE
